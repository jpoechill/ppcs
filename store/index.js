                    The Millenium Tower in San Francisco opened to resident in 2009, and includes two buildings – one over 12 stories tall, and the other over 58 stories. In 2016, it was discovered and released to the public that the tower was sinking and leaning. With this, many respective experts have been called to find a solution. The Millenium Tower is the fourth tallest building in San Francisco overall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Being DMU certified operators and trained industrial window cleaners, we were able to safely clean all of the exterior windows, and fix damaged areas due to the wind erosian, and the building's now infamous sink and lean.

                <p>
                    This project – for which we are able to complete multiple times a year – requires the highest level of safety, industry experience, and state certifications to complete.

                    A luxury condominium complex in the final stages of construction in downtown Palo Alto, hired us to perform a cleaning of their pre-cast panels and to apply an anti-graffiti sealant to the lower areas of the building.

                    We then pressure washed the panels to relieve any dust and dirt before we apply our sealer. After our final application of sealer, we cleaned all surrounding areas and let dry. The two coats of sealer used, dried transparent and remain invisible to the eye.
