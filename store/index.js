                    The Sitel Building in San Angelo, Texas had been through decades of harsh weather and needed our services to help preserve their structure.
                    There were many leaks penetrating into the building, so in turn, we removed all old caulking and replaced the backing rods throughout the property.

                    A luxury condominium complex in the final stages of construction in downtown Palo Alto, hired us to perform a cleaning of their pre-cast panels and to apply an anti-graffiti sealant to the lower areas of the building.

                <p>
                    This project required a timely set up to make sure everything around the panels were safely protected while we apply the necessary product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We then pressure washed the panels to relieve any dust and dirt before we apply our sealer. After our final application of sealer, we cleaned all surrounding areas and let dry. The two coats of sealer used, dried transparent and remain invisible to the eye.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were very satisfied with the outcome, and glad to help protect and seal this beautiful building in the heart of downtown Palo Alto.

                    The Hilton in Waco Texas had a good amount of wear and tear from decades of harsh weather and some structual failure.Our job was to remove calcium build up from the windows and window frames and restore them back to their original state.Once cleaned, we applied a metal defender to sustain its natural look and to protect from the elements of the environment.We also re - coated the EIFS of the entire building, and recaulked windows that had leakage issues.This building had great results and not to mention was a pleasure dealing with the friendly people of Texas.
