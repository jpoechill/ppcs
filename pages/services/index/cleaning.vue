          <h5>Eco-Friendly Building Restoration and Cleaning</h5>
          <p>
            The removal of years of carbon/biological build-up from GRFC Panels, stone, brick, concrete, aluminum clad and other materials used in fa√ßade construction is a delicate process. Our processes are as much an art as they are science. PPC&S methods combine a unique blend of cutting age technology, superior products and highly trained technicians.

          <p>  
            Before we begin the building restoration and cleaning process, we conduct comprehensive property consulting services. This involves discussing what results you want to assembling the correct materials and tools required for your project. We also make sure to give you a detailed written narrative of what your project needs, production schedules, and a detailed analysis of the cost.
