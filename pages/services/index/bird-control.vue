          <h5>Bird Control Systems</h5>
          <p>
            The droppings and nesting of pest birds cost individuals and businesses an estimated millions of dollars a year in clean-up expense, repairs, and damaged equipment. The corrosive effects of bird droppings can cause irreversible damage defacing rooftops, walkways, walls, vehicles, mechanical equipment, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bird droppings quickly turn to salt and ammonia and after it rains, electrochemical reactions speed up the rusting and corrosion processes. These acidic droppings eat away at paint, concrete, and metal, which eventually leads to structural failure. Over time, the droppings of pest birds can result in an expensive renovation of the structure and façade of your building!

            It is widely believed that corrosion caused by bird droppings was instrumental in causing metal fatigue leading to the collapse of the Madison, Wisconsin Bridge. Birds are known to carry over sixty transmissible diseases – some potentially fatal. Without properly installed and effective bird control systems, your building can become a potential hazard to your workers, customers, and anyone else who comes in contact with your building.
